    echo 'gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"' >>~/.gtkrc-2.0
    gconftool -t string --set /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme Emacs

Now ^W does what itâ€™s supposed to do, instead of e.g. accidentally closing the tab in Firefox. Yay.

What I really want are Vim key bindings in all text boxes, though.
