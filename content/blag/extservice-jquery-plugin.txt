I wrote a new jQuery plugin: [extservice][].

[extservice]: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/extservice

It allows you to add embedded items for external services to a webpage easily and with a consistent syntax.

Currently supported services:

*   Digg (the “digg it” button)
*   Disqus (the forum thread for your webpage)
*   Google Analytics (the tracking code)

It looks pretty much like this:

    // Find the element with id=digg and replace its contents (if any) with the
    // “digg it” button.
    $('#digg').loadDigg ();

    // Load Google Analytics.
    $.loadGoogleAnalytics ('UA-0123456-1');

[Download the plugin][get], or see it in use by viewing the source of this webpage or [my Heroes page][heroes].
