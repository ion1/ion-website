The [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][lectures] video lectures by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, recorded in the 1980s, are absolutely fascinating.

If you’re a programmer, you may learn new ideas and ways to think from those lectures, and become better at what you do.

If you learned to program in the schools of today, you **will** learn new ideas and ways to think, and become better at what you do. ;-)

Alas, some of the files contain a *very* muffled audio track.

Using the command

    mplayer -af equalizer=-12:-12:-12:0:0:0:12:12:-6:-12 Lecture-xx.avi

to play them seems to help a lot. (See the [mplayer][] website.)

For other players with a graphic equalizer, this means

*   canceling frequencies < 200 Hz (the overly emphasized bass frequencies)
*   amplifying frequencies about 2 kHz – 4 kHz (including the consonants in speech)
*   attenuating frequencies ≥ 8 kHz (the noise)
