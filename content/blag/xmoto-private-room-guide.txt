This is a short guide I give to people I give access to an XMoto private room.

To view the high scores or change your password, hit “[Private rooms][rooms]” on the [XMoto website][xmoto], choose the room and log in.

[rooms]: http://xmoto.tuxfamily.org/index.php?page=all_rooms
[xmoto]: http://xmoto.tuxfamily.org/

In the game, choose Options → WWW → Room 2 (I recommend leaving WR as the Reference room), activate the checkbox, select the room and input your credentials. Hit “Upload all highscores” to do a bulk upload.

Immediately after playing a level, you can hit “Upload” if you beat the current high score.
