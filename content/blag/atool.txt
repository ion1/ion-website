The `aunpack` utility from the [atool][] package extracts an archive, automatically choosing an appropriate unpacker depending on the archive’s type.

[atool]: http://www.nongnu.org/atool/

If there are multiple files in the archive’s root directory, `aunpack` extracts them to a new directory. Very handy.
